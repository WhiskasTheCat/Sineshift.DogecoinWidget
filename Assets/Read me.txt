About:
This is a windows desktop widget that shows current market data for Dogecoin.
The widget works as a 'portable' program without setup. Just unzip the files and execute Dogecoin Widget.exe. 
There is a setting to have the widget automatically start with windows.
Be aware that the widget will stay on your desktop behind all other windows. This is by design.

System requirements:
.NET 4.6.1
Windows 7 SP1, 8, 8.1 or 10
